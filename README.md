# MTKSVCR
demo of MTKSVCR and SACD-MTKSVCR

%%% MTKSVCR: A novel multi-task multi-class support vector machine with safe acceleration rule

%% This is a readme file of our code
%% All the .m files correspond to the proposed MTKSVCR and the safe acceleration rule, they should run in Matlab
%% The file contains MTKSVR.m, MTKSVCR_Finally.m, MTKSVCRScrCD.m, MTKSVCRScrCD_Finally.m, readme.txt and ExampleData.mat

%% Users who want to get the results of the primal MTKSVCR (without safe acceleration rule), see MTKSVR.m and MTKSVCR_Finally.m, please.
%    Run (two steps):
%            1. load('ExampleData.mat')
%            2. MTKSVCR_Finally

%% Users who want to get the results of the fast MTKSVCR with the safe acceleration rule, see MTKSVR.m and MTKSVCR_Finally.m, MTKSVCRScrCD.m and MTKSVCRScrCD_Finally.m, please.
% Run (two steps):
%           1. load('ExampleData.mat')
%           2. MTKSVCRScrCD_Finally

%% Refer to each .m file to get more specific comments, please.
